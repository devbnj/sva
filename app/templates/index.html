                7 days or a rigorous 21 days session, you return home a changed person. 
                Our daily sessions include</p>
            <p>Everyday Sunrise activities</p>
            <p>Noon activities, rest and rejuvenate</p>
            <p>Sunset activities. Lunch served at noon is light but wholesome, dinner at sunset is sumptuous</p>
