    "P": "Medium; burning, steaming",
    "K": "Least; heavy, dull, constant",
    "desc": "Pain is perhaps the chief characteristic of all disease. As Vata diseases tend to be more severe, they involve more pain. Strong, sharp, shocking and disruptive pain is the chief characteristic in Vata disorders. For Pitta, pain is usually associated with swelling, bleeding or burning sensation; for Kapha with feelings of dullness, heaviness, congestion or stagnation. Pain is most severe when there is a blockage of the channels and wrong movement in the channels."
