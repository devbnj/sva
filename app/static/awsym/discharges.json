    "desc": "The main characteristic of Kapha disorders is excess discharges particularly phlegm, water (as in watery skin sores or rashes) and pus, mainly whitish in color. Pitta also causes an increase of discharges, including sweating, bile in the system, bleeding and pus (toxins in the blood). Vata has the least discharges as it is subtler in nature, mainly intestinal gas or other noises, cracking of the joints, or moaning and sighing, which are all discharges of Vata."
