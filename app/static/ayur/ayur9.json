    "body": "Ayurveda statuses three lifeforces or Doshas in the body. Doshas are primary forces and subtle substances supporting every physiological and psychological function. While they produce and sustain the body, they also are the causes for the disease process. Ayurveda is essentially the science of Doshas. ",
    "para1": "Vata, Pitta and Kapha correspond primarily to the elements of air, fire, and water. They are the active or mobile (Rajasik side) of the five elements that determine the life processes of growth and decay. ",
    "para2": "“Vata” is the air humor which means the “wind”. Vata is the prime force of the nervous system. It governs our sensory and mental balance, our sensory and motor orientation, and gives us mental adaptability and comprehension. It is the basic vital or life force (prana) deriving primarily from our breath - the energizing force for the entire body. Pitta is the biological fire humor which means the “bile”. Pitta is responsible for all chemical and metabolic transformations in the body. It governs our mental digestion, our capacity to perceive reality and understand things as they are. It derives primarily from our power to digest food. “Kapha” is the biological water humor which means “phlegm”. Kapha gives nourishment, provides substance, and offers support. It makes up the bulk of our bodily tissues. It provides our emotional support in life and governs such positive emotional traits as love, compassion, modesty, patience, and forgiveness. It serves as a vehicle, container or substratum for the other two forces.",
