    "body": "During Gautam Buddha's period (c. 500 BCE), Ayurveda was a practiced healing method, mature with a long history. Ayurveda spread during his influence throughout the eastern hemisphere. Ayurveda influenced other western regions as well, even traditional Greek medicine where a similar model comprising biological humors as in the medicine of Hippocrates recited in Grecian literatures. This period was also one of diversification. Soon Ayurveda spread into different areas of Southeast Asia, Indochina, Indonesia, and Japan. Different cultures adapted Ayurveda adding their own insights and practices to the system. Followers of Buddha in the east adapted principles of Ayurveda. The Buddhist Ayurvedic Sage and siddha Nagarjuna of Andhra Pradesh (c. 100 CE) was an Ayurvedic doctor. He wrote commentaries on Sushruta Samhita and developed many Ayurvedic herbal preparations used even today.",
    "para1": "Vagbhatta of Sindh revisited the Ayurvedic system, as explained in his classic, the third of the main Ayurvedic texts, Ashtanga Hridaya (c. 500 CE). Vagbhatta infused the teachings of Charaka and Sushruta and put them into a concise form for easy learning. His text is the background for this course because of his clear summaries of Ayurvedic principles. Commentaries on it are also the basis of Tibetan medicine, which is largely Ayurvedic. Tibetan Ayurveda developed after the coming of Buddhism to Tibet in the eighth century.",
    "para2": "The alchemical side of Ayurveda and its usage of special mineral preparations, which remain central to Ayurveda today, evolved after Nagarjuna into the Middle Ages. The revised Ayurveda was devised to replace Soma, a special herbal healing mixtures of the early Vedic era, the secret to which was lost."
