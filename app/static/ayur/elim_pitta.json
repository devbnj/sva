    "sy1": "While Pitta types usually do not suffer from constipation, this condition does sometimes arise. When the hot quality of Pitta predominates over the wet quality, dryness arises which can lead to constipation.",

    "tr1": "When the condition is mild, laxatives like Triphala, Amalaki (as in the form of the jelly Chyavan Prash), or psyllium are effective, but sometimes milk with ghee before sleep is enough. In severe conditions, particularly the constipation that follows a febrile disease, bitters are more effective (like rhubarb root). In this case, however, the herbs usually only have to be given once or a few times.",
    "tr2": "Purgation therapy is very effective for alleviating high Pitta, but it needs to be prepared properly. If the toxins have not reached their site in the digestive tract, it is of little use to flush them out. One will only be working the organs excessively and possibly damaging their tone.",
