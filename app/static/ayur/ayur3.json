Ayurveda survived through private training and smaller schools for hundreds of years in Asia under different names and practices.",
    "para1": "Since World War 2 end, Ayurveda and its many schools has gradually regained influence, though it remains poorly funded. More than a hundred Ayurvedic schools flourish in India. Many unfunded schools thrive in China and Asia, though most are small with a few hundred students. Many Ayurvedic companies and herbal farms also exist, with Ayurvedic products found in stores and pharmacies throughout Asia.
