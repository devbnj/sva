    "tr1": "Triphala is usually sufficient for this, though some bitter laxatives may be helpful short term as well. Though bitter laxatives are helpful for Kapha, they should be combined with spices like Trikatu. In themselves, bitters are cold and can further lower the metabolism or weaken the digestion of Kapha and Vata types. The intake of additional spicy herbs helps balance this condition. Bitters like barberry ease the flow of bile that aids both Pitta and Kapha and helps prevent the formation of gallstones. Again, it is the proper measure that must be borne in mind. Meanwhile, one should always treat Kapha by hot spices as the root of Kapha disorders is in the stomach. For Kapha, the large intestine is just an overflow or drainage site, not the origin of the problem.",
    "tr2": "Many so-called herbal dietary teas and formulas contain laxatives. A number of them have large amounts of bitter laxatives like senna that can aggravate chronic constipation. Hence, while they appear to work short term to reduce weight, their long-term affects are not always good. The primary therapy for weight reduction in Kapha types is not to promote elimination, but to raise the metabolism. For this, it is good to take formulas like Trikatu, which raises the metabolism in the stomach, and Triphala, which normalizes absorption in the colon, together. In addition, one can add guggul, which clears plaque and fat, and a bitter herb like gentian or Ayurvedic katuka, which clears the liver and pancreas and aids in sugar and fat metabolism. This creates a good overall formula for weight reduction such as many Ayurvedic companies offer.",
